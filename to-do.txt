 Create the following main files:

index.html (HTML structure)

style.css (for styling the game)

game.js (game logic)

README.txt (brief explanation of your project)

3. HTML Structure (index.html)
 Create basic HTML structure (DOCTYPE, <html>, <head>, and <body>).

 Add a container for the game board (<div id="gameArea">).

 Add a scoreboard (<div id="score">).

 Add a timer (<div id="timer">).

 Add a pause menu section (<div id="pauseMenu">) with buttons for "Restart" and "Continue".

4. CSS Styling (style.css)
 Style the game area (set width, height, and borders for the Tetris grid).

 Style the scoreboard (position it at the top of the game area).

 Style the timer (position it near the scoreboard).

 Style the pause menu (position it at the center of the screen, with hidden state initially).

 Make sure the game looks good across multiple screen sizes.

5. Game Logic - JavaScript (game.js)
5.1 Game Initialization
 Create the game board (grid) in memory (an array of 10x20 for a 10x20 grid).

 Create an object for the current tetromino, including shape and rotation state.

 Initialize the score and timer variables.

 Initialize game over/lives tracking.

5.2 Key Events / Controls
 Set up event listeners for keyboard controls (left, right, down, rotate).

 Ensure key events are smooth (e.g., hold down a key for continuous movement).

 Implement moveLeft, moveRight, moveDown, and rotateTetromino functions.

 Ensure smooth key repeat functionality for continuous movement.

5.3 Game Loop / Animation
 Set up the main game loop using requestAnimationFrame.

 Implement updateGame() to move tetrominoes, check for collisions, and update the game state.

 Implement drawGame() to render the game grid, blocks, and score.

 Ensure the game runs at 60 FPS and doesn't drop frames.

5.4 Gravity and Collision Detection
 Implement gravity for the tetromino (automatically falling).

 Implement collision detection when the tetromino moves or rotates.

 Prevent tetrominoes from moving out of bounds or overlapping with already placed blocks.

5.5 Line Clearing & Scoring
 Check if a line is completely filled after each tetromino placement.

 Clear any full lines and shift down remaining lines.

 Update the score based on the number of lines cleared (e.g., +100 points per line).

  Implement levels: Increase game speed after clearing certain lines (e.g., speed up every 10 lines cleared).

   Change the background picture when the player progresses to the next level.

5.6 Game Over Detection
 End the game when a new tetromino collides with the stack at the top of the grid.

 Show the game over screen (display final score).

5.7 Pause Functionality
 Implement a pause function that freezes the game state and shows the pause menu.

 Implement a "Continue" button to resume the game and a "Restart" button to restart the game.

5.8 Timer
 Implement a timer that counts up from 0 or down from a set value (e.g., 3 minutes).

 Display the timer on the screen.

 Stop the timer when the game is paused.

6. misc.
 Add background music and sound effects (e.g., sound when lines clear, game over sound).

 Add animation effects for line clearing (fade or slide).

 Display high scores stored in localStorage.


7. Testing & Optimization
 Test the game for performance and ensure it runs at 60 FPS.

 Use browser developer tools to inspect performance (FPS, memory usage, paint flashing).

 Optimize DOM manipulation (e.g., minimize reflows/repaints).

 Test game controls for smoothness—ensure no jank or stutter.

8. Debugging & Final Touches
 Add console.log() statements to debug (e.g., for collision detection, line clearing, etc.).

 Remove or comment out debugging statements before the final release.

 Write a README.txt to explain the game, instructions, and any known issues.

9. Deployment & Distribution
 Host the game online (use platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify).

 Share the game link with others to play and give feedback.

10. Documentation
 Update README.txt with instructions on how to play, controls, and game rules.

 Add a brief overview of your development process and what you've learned from the project.

This checklist gives you a clear outline of everything that needs to be done to complete your Tetris game project. You can break it down into manageable steps and work through it at your own pace. Good luck, and feel free to ask for any more help along the way!



Color palette:
I-Tetromino (Light Blue): Soft light blue (e.g., #A3D8FF) – This is a calming color that’s easy on the eyes.

O-Tetromino (Light Yellow): Soft pastel yellow (e.g., #FFF1A8) – A warm, neutral yellow that contrasts enough without being too bright.

T-Tetromino (Soft Purple): Light lavender (e.g., #D4A6FF) – Purple tones are soothing and distinct from other colors.

L-Tetromino (Soft Coral): Soft coral or peach (e.g., #FFB6A6) – A light, warm peach that works well visually and is calming.

J-Tetromino (Mint Green): Soft mint or pastel green (e.g., #A3FFB6) – Green tones are often seen as soothing and calming.

S-Tetromino (Light Green): Pale green (e.g., #A7D8A3) – A calming pastel shade of green.

Z-Tetromino (Soft Pink): Light pastel pink (e.g., #F3C9E0) – A soft, neutral pink to give a pleasant visual effect.

Color-Blind Mode Palette:
For color-blindness accessibility, color contrast and shape differentiation are key. The palette should still be soothing, but with clear contrasts so that people with different types of color blindness (e.g., red-green blindness, blue-yellow blindness) can distinguish the blocks.

You can use the Color Universal Design (CUD) color scheme, which ensures that your colors are visible to people with various types of color vision deficiencies.

Here’s a modified version of your palette that could work well for color-blind users:

I-Tetromino (Cyan): Use a cyan or teal (e.g., #4CC9FF) – This is distinct and visible for most types of color blindness.

O-Tetromino (Yellow-Green): A pale yellow-green (e.g., #C6D000) – Easy to differentiate from the other colors.

T-Tetromino (Pink): A soft pink (e.g., #FF66B2) – A color that stands out for those with red-green color blindness.

L-Tetromino (Blue): Light blue (e.g., #2E9CCF) – Easy to differentiate and a cool, calming color.

J-Tetromino (Orange): A medium orange (e.g., #FFA500) – Orange is a color that’s generally distinguishable by most color-blind users.

S-Tetromino (Bright Green): Green (e.g., #55B82C) – A color that contrasts well against the background and is noticeable for all types of color blindness.

Z-Tetromino (Purple): A light purple (e.g., #A16CFF) – This color stands out and contrasts with others while being visible.

By using this scheme, users who are color-blind should still be able to distinguish the different Tetrominoes clearly.
